## 🚀 WHAT IT DOES

### The Problem It Solves

**Before:**
```bash
# Remember 20+ different commands
subfinder -d target.com -o output1.txt
nmap -sV -sC -p 80,443 target.com -oN output2.txt
gobuster dir -u https://target.com -w wordlist.txt -o output3.txt
nikto -h https://target.com -output output4.txt
sqlmap -u "https://target.com/page?id=1" --batch
# ... and 15 more commands
# ... then manually organize all output files
# ... then remember what each scan found
```

**After:**
```bash
./launch.sh
# 1. Enter URL: https://target.com
# 2. Check boxes for scans you want
# 3. Click START
# Done! Watch it all happen in real-time!
```

## 🔥 REAL-WORLD EXAMPLE

### Scenario: GoCardless Bug Bounty

```bash
# 1. Launch TUI
./launch.sh

# 2. Configure
Target: https://manage-sandbox.gocardless.com

Scans Selected:
☑ Subdomain Enumeration   ← Find all subdomains
☑ Port Scanning           ← Check what's running
☑ Directory Bruteforce    ← Find hidden endpoints
☑ Technology Detection    ← Identify tech stack
☑ Historical URLs         ← Check old endpoints

# 3. Run (15-20 minutes)

# 4. Results
Found:
- 5 subdomains (api, manage, connect, pay, oauth)
- Open port 443 (HTTPS)
- 47 directories/files
- Tech: Ruby on Rails, Nginx, Cloudflare
- 234 historical URLs from archive

# 5. Next Steps
- Test IDOR on discovered endpoints

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES

### ✅ Legal & Ethical

**ONLY USE ON:**
- ✅ Your own systems
- ✅ Authorized bug bounty programs
- ✅ Penetration testing engagements
- ✅ Educational labs (with permission)

**NEVER USE ON:**
- ❌ Unauthorized systems
- ❌ Production systems (without approval)
- ❌ Other people's websites
- ❌ Malicious purposes

### 🛡️ Safety Features

The TUI includes several safety features:
1. Requires explicit target input (no default targets)
2. All scans are read-only (reconnaissance only)
3. Results stored locally only
4. No data exfiltration
5. Respects rate limits
6. 5-minute timeout per scan (prevents hanging)

### 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Always get authorization first**
2. **Start with passive recon** (subdomains, tech detection)
3. **Then active scanning** (ports, directories)
4. **Manual testing last** (SQLmap, XSS)
5. **Document everything** (screenshots, notes)
6. **Report responsibly** (via proper channels)
