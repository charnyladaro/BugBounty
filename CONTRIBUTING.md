## üé® Style Guidelines

### Python Code Style

Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/):

```python
# Good
def scan_target(target_url: str, scan_types: list) -> dict:
    """
    Execute scans on target.
    
    Args:
        target_url: The target URL to scan
        scan_types: List of scan types to run
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary of scan results
    """
    results = {}
    for scan_type in scan_types:
        results[scan_type] = execute_scan(scan_type, target_url)
    return results

# Bad
def scan(t,s):
    r={}
    for x in s:
        r[x]=execute_scan(x,t)
    return r
```

### Documentation Style

```python
# Good docstring
def execute_scan(self, scan_type: str) -> str:
    """
    Execute a specific scan type.
    
    Args:
        scan_type: Type of scan ('subdomains', 'ports', etc.)
        
    Returns:
        Output from the scan command
        
    Raises:
        subprocess.TimeoutExpired: If scan takes >5 minutes
        Exception: For other scan failures
    """
    pass

# Bad docstring
def execute_scan(self, scan_type):
    # does a scan
    pass
```

### Variable Naming

```python
# Good
target_url = "https://example.com"
scan_results = {}
is_scanning = False
total_scans = 10

# Bad
url = "https://example.com"
res = {}
flag = False
num = 10
```

### Code Organization

```python
# Good structure
class BugBountyTUI(App):
    """Main application class."""
    
    # Constants
    TITLE = "Bug Bounty TUI"
    
    # Initialization
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.config = ScanConfig()
    
    # UI Methods
    def compose(self) -> ComposeResult:
        pass
    
    # Event Handlers
    def on_button_pressed(self, event):
        pass
    
    # Action Methods
    def action_run_scan(self):
        pass
    
    # Helper Methods
    def _execute_command(self, cmd):
        pass
```

### Comments

```python
# Good comments
# Calculate scan progress as percentage
progress = (completed_scans / total_scans) * 100

# Execute subprocess with 5-minute timeout to prevent hanging
result = subprocess.run(cmd, timeout=300)

# Bad comments
# set progress
progress = (completed_scans / total_scans) * 100

# run command
result = subprocess.run(cmd, timeout=300)
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

Understanding the code structure:

```
bugbounty-tui.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ScanConfig class          # Configuration management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ WelcomeScreen class       # Welcome screen
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ResultsScreen class       # Results display
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ BugBountyTUI class        # Main application
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ compose()             # UI layout
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ on_button_pressed()   # Button handlers
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ action_*()            # Keyboard shortcuts
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ run_scans()           # Scan orchestration
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ execute_scan()        # Individual scan execution
```

### Adding a New Scan Type

1. **Add checkbox** (line ~250):
```python
yield Checkbox("üî• New Scanner (newtool)", value=False, id="scan_newtool")
```

2. **Add to scan selection** (line ~330):
```python
if self.query_one("#scan_newtool", Checkbox).value:
    scans.append("newtool")
```

3. **Add command** (line ~390):
```python
commands = {
    # ... existing commands ...
    "newtool": f"newtool {target} -o {output_dir}/newtool.txt"
}
```

4. **Update documentation**
   - Add to README.md features
   - Add to tool list
   - Update installation instructions if needed
