## ⬆️ FILES TO UPLOAD TO GITHUB (13-15 files)

### Essential Files (MUST UPLOAD - 8 files)

These are **required** for your repository to work:

1. **README.md** - Main documentation (⭐ MOST IMPORTANT!)
2. **LICENSE** - MIT License
3. **.gitignore** - Git ignore rules (hidden file!)
4. **requirements.txt** - Python dependencies
5. **bugbounty-tui.py** - Main application
6. **launch.sh** - Launcher script
7. **install-tools.sh** - Tool installer
8. **CONTRIBUTING.md** - How to contribute

### Documentation Files (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED - 5 files)

These make your repo professional and helpful:

9. **QUICKSTART.md** - 5-minute setup guide
10. **README-TUI.md** - Complete feature documentation
11. **WINDOWS-GUIDE.md** - Windows/WSL instructions
12. **VISUAL-DEMO.md** - Interface preview
13. **GoCardless-BugBounty-Guide.md** - Bug bounty methodology

### Optional Documentation (2 files)

Nice to have but not essential:

14. **INDEX.md** - File reference guide
15. **SUMMARY.md** - Project overview

**Minimum to upload: 8 files**  
**Recommended to upload: 13 files**  
**Maximum to upload: 15 files**

## 📚 FILES FOR REFERENCE ONLY (3 files)

These are **guides to help YOU upload** - don't upload these to GitHub:

1. **START-HERE.md** - This guide you're reading! Upload instructions.
2. **GITHUB-STRUCTURE.md** - Repository structure explained
3. **GITHUB-CHECKLIST.md** - Pre-upload checklist

**Why not upload these?**
- They're meta-documentation (about uploading, not about the tool)
- Users don't need upload instructions
- Keep your repo clean and focused

**What to do with them:**
- Keep on your local computer
- Use as reference when needed
- Delete after successful upload (optional)

## 🗂️ Organizing Files for Upload

### Method 1: Select and Upload

```bash
# Create a clean directory
mkdir github-upload
cd github-upload

# Copy ONLY files you want to upload
cp ~/path/to/README.md .
cp ~/path/to/LICENSE .
cp ~/path/to/.gitignore .
cp ~/path/to/bugbounty-tui.py .
# ... etc for all files you want

# Verify
ls -la

# Should show 13-15 files, NOT 18
```

### Method 2: Upload All, Remove Later

```bash
# Upload everything first
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push

# Then remove reference files
git rm START-HERE.md
git rm GITHUB-STRUCTURE.md
git rm GITHUB-CHECKLIST.md
git commit -m "docs: Remove upload reference files"
git push
```

### Method 3: Selective Git Add

```bash
# Initialize repo
git init

# Add only what you want
git add README.md LICENSE .gitignore requirements.txt
git add bugbounty-tui.py launch.sh install-tools.sh
git add CONTRIBUTING.md QUICKSTART.md README-TUI.md
git add WINDOWS-GUIDE.md VISUAL-DEMO.md
git add GoCardless-BugBounty-Guide.md

# Check what will be committed
git status

# Should show 13 files (or however many you chose)

# Commit and push
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Keep Reference Files Locally

```bash
# Create a reference folder
mkdir ~/bug-bounty-tui-reference
mv START-HERE.md ~/bug-bounty-tui-reference/
mv GITHUB-*.md ~/bug-bounty-tui-reference/

# You can always refer back to them
```

### Tip 2: Use .gitignore to Exclude Reference Files

If you want them in your local folder but not on GitHub:

```bash
# Add to .gitignore
echo "START-HERE.md" >> .gitignore
echo "GITHUB-STRUCTURE.md" >> .gitignore
echo "GITHUB-CHECKLIST.md" >> .gitignore

# Git will ignore these files
```

### Tip 3: Create a Branch for Everything

```bash
# Upload everything to a test branch first
git checkout -b test-upload
git add .
git push -u origin test-upload

# Review on GitHub
# If good, merge to main
# If not, delete branch and try again
```

## 🎯 Quick Decision Guide

### "Which files should I upload?"

**Minimum viable repo:**
→ 8 essential files

**Professional repo:**
→ 13 files (essential + docs)

**Comprehensive repo:**
→ 15 files (everything except reference guides)

### "What about the reference guides?"

**Keep them locally** - You might need them for:
- Future uploads
- Helping others
- Reference when making changes

**Don't upload them** - GitHub users don't need:
- Instructions on how to upload to GitHub
- Repository structure guides
- Pre-upload checklists
